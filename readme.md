## rNote
Write your forum posts... In Markdown.

Open web app [here](http://rnote-editor.github.io/app).

### About
I tend to write posts on public forums. phpBB is a nice forum software and all, but in my opinion, the workflow when it comes to writing, previewing and
publishing posts is very counter-intuitive. I would much rather have some type of live preview of my work, instead of having to click "Preview Post" every time
and refresh the page.

Thus, we have **rNote**. Posts you make in rNote are saved to LocalStorage, so they are available offline. I used *[Polymer](http://polymer-project.org)* to
create this, as it provides you with a wealth of easily reusable Material Design components, and lets you compose your own components to your own vision.

### Potential Future Features
* Save to your computer
* Import BBCode
* Text editor buttons for convenience (i.e.a bold button)

### Thanks
Thanks for using rNote. If you have any feedback, I'm all ears. :)
